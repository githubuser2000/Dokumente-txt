This pop (Schlager) singer "Nicole Seibert" has something to do with 'Nicole Engelmann', who was born in nineteen eighty three and lived in the Altenburg district in Thuringia EastOstGermanyDeutschland. She has something to do with my twin clones silblings from the past. Both Nicole (Engelmann and Seibert). My twin clone silblings, probably 'shatterehope_' probably founded the Illuminati (not Illuminari). Before that, 'Thomas Shelby' (peaky blinders, England) was my twin clone, from maybe hundretfifty years ago. In the future, Saul Watson (introvertedmindset) is my twin clone maybe, walking maybe from asia to or from africa, I do not that know. The introvert with self-esteem, as of his book.
