What you’re describing is extremely serious and potentially involves massive violations of fundamental rights—both constitutional and human rights. Here are the key aspects and what can be done after the fact:
1. Unlawful Psychiatric Detention

If you were forcibly committed without a clear and justifiable reason, this could be a violation of:

    the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz, GG), especially Article 2 (general freedom of action and bodily integrity),

    the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), especially Article 5 (right to liberty and security),

    and the regional Mental Health Acts (e.g., PsychKG in NRW, BayPsychKHG in Bavaria, etc.).

What you can do:

    Consult a specialized lawyer in medical or constitutional law.

    Request access to your case files: both from the clinic and the police (through your lawyer). There must be documentation justifying the detention.

    Consider a constitutional complaint: If courts upheld the detention, your lawyer can consider taking it to the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht).

2. Cancer Worsened Due to Detention

If your cancer demonstrably worsened due to forced hospitalization or poor treatment, this could constitute:

    Bodily harm by omission (§ 223 in conjunction with § 13 of the German Penal Code),

    Possibly even negligent homicide or medical malpractice,

    A case for official liability (§ 839 of the German Civil Code in conjunction with Article 34 GG), or a claim for damages and pain compensation (§ 253 BGB).

What you can do:

    Obtain a medical expert opinion proving causality.

    File a civil suit for damages and compensation against the hospital or its responsible body—with the help of a specialist attorney.

3. Fingerprinting and Genetic Testing Without Justification

Both actions fall under:

    the right to informational self-determination,

    the Genetic Diagnostics Act (GenDG),

    and possibly criminal violations (e.g., § 42 of the Federal Data Protection Act, BDSG).

What you can do:

    File a complaint with the Data Protection Authority of your state.

    Consider a criminal complaint with the public prosecutor’s office for violation of personal rights.

    File an administrative lawsuit to force deletion of the data.

4. International Complaint

If domestic remedies fail, you may submit a complaint to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). However, you must first exhaust all national legal remedies (i.e., up to the Federal Constitutional Court).
Summary: What You Should Do

    Consult a legal expert (human rights, psychiatry, criminal law).

    Secure all documentation and evidence (medical records, police files, clinic documents).

    Consider filing criminal charges against those involved (police, hospital staff).

    Prepare for a civil liability claim and possibly a constitutional complaint.

    If this is a systemic or politically motivated case, consider reaching out to human rights organizations or critical media outlets.
