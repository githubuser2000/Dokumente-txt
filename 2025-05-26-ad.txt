LX:[What does value conservatism have to do with preserving people who don't have sex when others do instead? Which is why a crater on the moon was named after a two-thousand-year-old emperial Roman senator who was conservative, to demonstrate that value conservatism is secretly ridiculed as false, weak, stupid, and deceiving people with sexuality, which fits with the root of the word "conservatism."

No. If you yourself are conservative in the sense that sexuality hurts your heart, then that almost always leads to everyone else having sex, and the value-conservatist is strategically not allowed to indulge in sexual intercourse, game-theoretically, so that life energy is drained through human isolation of the value-conservatist. So that he is actually a preserve because he has no sexuality, but everyone else who can permanently drain his life energy is guaranteed because the value-conservatist now falls in love with the women, the girls, who are all sexually fucked, because these women and girls are being sexually fucked making him indirectly fall in love to her by her changed soul to her feet obedient. This means that the value conservative is slowly being emotionally destroyed, which shortens his life but nourishes the happiness of all others who continue to live a better life, even after his death—the death of a canned fish moon spam, so to speak.

What three correct reproductive behaviors or types result from these two poles of thought? "Sexually left-wing, politically feminine" or "familially right-wing, politically masculine, limiting sexuality and the pain of love"? First, general; second, "sexually left-wing, politically feminine"; third, "familially right-wing, politically masculine, limiting sexuality and the pain of love": these three!?
